title: Abstract Algebra and Real Analysis Self-Study Guide
permalink: /stuff/
---

This is a self-study guide for introductory upper-division mathematics that I am currently compiling for my friend. 

Textbooks:
* Fraleigh – A First Course in Abstract Algebra, 7th edition
* Rudin - Principles of Mathematical Analysis, 3rd edition

How to use this study guide:

Each lesson covers the material of around 1-2 lectures. Under each lesson, the chapters of the book covered are given, and for each chapter the most relevant reading material is given. 5.14, for example, means the reader should understand Definition/Theorem/Corollary 5.14. "Roots of Unity", for example, means the reader should understand the section "Roots of Unity" in the book. The suggested reading material aims to highlight the most important parts of the text so that a lazy person can read as few as possible while being able to grasp the main takeaways of the chapter. Doing the exercises, like all math courses, are important, so the reader should aim to do most, if not all, of them. For the abstract algebra section, I selected exercises that are more proof-based than computational as this study guide is designed for a person who has a rigorous background in proof-based mathematics.

Lessons or sections with an asterisk * means that while the topic is important in its own right, it is not essential to later discussion, and thus may be skipped if the reader inclines to do so.
