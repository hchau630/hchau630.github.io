  <p class="title">Learning Disentagled Representation of Images <span style="color: red;">(Ongoing Project)</span></p>
  <p>How do humans learn to recognize transformations in the visual scene, such as rotation and scaling, that are independent of object identities? The question of how to form representation of images that disentangle visual transformations from objects is of interest both to neuroscientists and computer scientists. In this work we develop a probabilistic inference algorithm capable of learning a representation of rotated MNIST digits that independently encodes digit identity and rotation. Our algorithm currently only factorizes one-parameter Lie group transformations, but it can be generalized to n-parameter transformations.

  <p class="title">Emergence of opposite neurons in a firing-rate model of multisensory processing</p>
  <p>Multisensory integration areas such as dorsal medial superior temporal (MSTd) and ventral intraparietal (VIP) areas in macaques combine visual and vestibular cues to produce better estimates of self-motion. Congruent and opposite neurons, two types of neurons found in these areas, prefer congruent inputs and opposite inputs from the two modalities respectively. We created a firing-rate model of multisensory processing to explain how the unique tuning properties of opposite neurons may arise from biologically realistic synaptic learning mechanisms. This research may have broader implications about how the brain learns to perform causal inference - the ability to decide which of the competing explanations for sensory inputs is the most likely one - as opposite neurons have been hypothesized to be involved in causal inference in multisensory processing.
