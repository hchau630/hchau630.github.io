  Hi! I'm a first year Neurobiology and Behavior PhD student at Columbia University. I studied physics and math as an undergrad, and as a theoretical neuroscientist, I like to think about how mathematical tools from these fields can help us answer neuroscience questions. Currently I am doing my rotation with Stefano Fusi, studying how abstract quantities are represented in the brain using tools from differential geometry.
